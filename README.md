# Geospatial Data Science Projects

This repository contains independent projects developed for research and applied remote sensing and machine learning tasks.

The codes included here cover:
- Flood mapping using multi-sensor satellite data (Sentinel-1 & Sentinel-2) in Google Earth Engine.
- Deep learning classification of açaí palm trees vs other palm species.
- Cerrado deforestation monitoring methodology adaptation aligned with EU Regulation, including time series clustering and edge/border analysis.

## Projects

### 1) Flood Mapping and NDWI Analysis
A flood mapping workflow built in Google Earth Engine, integrating SAR (Sentinel-1) and optical (Sentinel-2) data. NDWI is used to support large-scale flood detection, especially in urban environments.

### 2) Palm Tree Classification
A Python deep learning project designed to differentiate açaí palm trees from other palm species using supervised classification techniques.

### 3) Cerrado Deforestation Monitoring (EU Regulation)
A methodological improvement of PRODES-like deforestation monitoring for the Cerrado biome, adapted to meet traceability requirements under EU Regulation (2023/1115). The workflow integrates Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-1 time series and applies unsupervised machine learning (SOM + HCA), including deforestation edge/border calculations.

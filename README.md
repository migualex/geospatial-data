## Geospatial Data Science

Code 1) The Flood Mapping and NDWI Analysis Using Sentinel-1 & Sentinel-2 code was part of the SER-247 course at INPE. There is an agreement between spatial agencies aimed at supporting satellite missions focused on natural disasters. This trend has stimulated more research in this field, and significant progress has been achieved in recent years through collaboration with the International Charter Space and Major Disasters. It presents an integration test model for RADAR products on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform. The goal was to leverage datasets available in GEE to map large urban flood areas using NDWI. 

Code 2) the Palm Trees code is part of my work with Deep Learning using Python. I used it to differentiate açaí palm trees from other palm species.

# \# Palm Tree Classification (Açaí vs Other Palm Species) — Deep Learning

# 

# This project is part of my Deep Learning studies using Python. The main goal is to classify and differentiate \*\*açaí palm trees\*\* from other palm species using machine learning and computer vision techniques.

# 

# \## Overview

# 

# Palm species can present strong visual similarity depending on image resolution, viewing angle, and environmental conditions. This repository contains an experimental workflow to train and evaluate a model capable of distinguishing açaí palms from other palm types.

# 

# \## Objectives

# 

# \- Build a supervised learning workflow for palm classification

# \- Train a deep learning model for species differentiation

# \- Evaluate model performance using standard metrics

# \- Support research applications in vegetation mapping and land use monitoring

# 

# \## Approach

# 

# Depending on the notebook implementation, the workflow may include:

# 

# \- Data loading and labeling

# \- Image pre-processing:

# &nbsp; - resizing

# &nbsp; - normalization

# &nbsp; - augmentation (rotation, flips, brightness, etc.)

# \- Model training:

# &nbsp; - CNN-based architecture (e.g., custom CNN or transfer learning)

# \- Validation and testing

# \- Performance evaluation:

# &nbsp; - accuracy

# &nbsp; - confusion matrix

# &nbsp; - precision / recall / F1-score

# 

# \## Requirements

# 

# \- Python 3.x

# \- Common libraries:

# &nbsp; - NumPy

# &nbsp; - Pandas

# &nbsp; - Matplotlib

# &nbsp; - Scikit-learn

# &nbsp; - TensorFlow / Keras or PyTorch (depending on the implementation)

# 

# \## Outputs

# 

# \- Trained model weights

# \- Training curves (loss/accuracy)

# \- Classification metrics

# \- Predictions for new imagery

# 

# \## Disclaimer

# 

# This project is a research and learning exercise and may require dataset-specific tuning for operational use.

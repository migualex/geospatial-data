# Palm Tree Classification (Açaí vs Other Palm Species)

This project is part of my Deep Learning studies using Python. The main goal is to classify and differentiate **açaí palm trees** from other palm species using machine learning and computer vision techniques.

## Overview

Palm species can present strong visual similarity depending on image resolution, viewing angle, and environmental conditions. This repository contains an experimental workflow to train and evaluate a model capable of distinguishing açaí palms from other palm types.

## Objectives

- Build a supervised learning workflow for palm classification
- Train a deep learning model for species differentiation
- Evaluate model performance using standard metrics
- Support research applications in vegetation mapping and land use monitoring

## Approach

Depending on the notebook implementation, the workflow may include:

- Data loading and labeling
- Image pre-processing:
  - resizing
  - normalization
  - augmentation (rotation, flips, brightness, etc.)
- Model training:
  - CNN-based architecture (e.g., custom CNN or transfer learning)
- Validation and testing
- Performance evaluation:
  - accuracy
  - confusion matrix
  - precision / recall / F1-score

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Common libraries:
  - NumPy
  - Pandas
  - Matplotlib
  - Scikit-learn
  - TensorFlow / Keras or PyTorch (depending on the implementation)

## Outputs

- Trained model weights
- Training curves (loss/accuracy)
- Classification metrics
- Predictions for new imagery

# This project is a research and learning exercise and may require dataset-specific tuning for operational use.
